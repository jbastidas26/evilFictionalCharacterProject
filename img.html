                  <p>The Omnimatrix Prototype (abbreviated and better known as Omnitrix), was a very powerful professional alien device in the form of a terrestrial clock that was attached to Ben's wrist in the first episode of the series and is the device that the series and the franchise revolved environment. After its destruction, it was replaced by the Omnitrix II.</p>

               <p>The Omnimatrix, (commonly known as the Omnitrix or New Omnitrix) is one of the most important creations of Azmuth and the successor of the Ultimatrix and the original Omnitrix.</p>

                <p>The Ultimatrix (or Superomnitrix1), is a very powerful,large-sized,gauntlet-shaped professional device,in which the Ben 10 series: Alien Supremacy focuses. Ben uses it to replace the Omnitrix, which destroys itself in the episode "The Final Battle" with Vilgax to prevent him from taking over the universe.
                Unlike the Omnitrix, this Omnitrix has the ability to transform the user into evolved versions of aliens, known as supreme versions.</p>

                <p>On one occasion, when Kevin Levin slept, he dreamed of creating the Antitrix, based on the Omnitrix. He immediately made the plans of the device and managed to manufacture it. He also added other functions, such as genetically improving his aliens (resulting in mutants) and removing the time limit.</p>
