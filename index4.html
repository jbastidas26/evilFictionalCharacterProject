       <p>The gem is able to generate a powerful personal force field to protect its user.

The force field can become a knight-like shield on the arm or a dome/sphere to protect the user's whole body, and is able to defend them from attacks such as Ultimos' punches, Jetray's neuroshock blasts, or the guns of a large spaceship. It was also able to cut clean through that same spaceship.</p>
